      const players = ["Wes", "Sarah", "Ryan", "Poppy"];

      // and we want to make a copy of it.
      const team = players;

      // You might think we can just do something like this:
      team[5] = "lux";

      // however what happens when we update that array?

      // now here is the problem!

      // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

      // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

      // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
      const teamx = players.slice();

      // one way
      const zteam = Array.from(teamx);

      // or create a new array and concat the old one in
      const team2 = [].concat(players);
      // or use the new ES6 Spread
      const xteam = [...players];

      // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

      // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

      // with Objects
      const person = {
        name: "Nnah Ukponoabasi",
        age: 98
      };

      // and think we make a copy:
      const newbie = person; //wrong copy but cool reference

      // how do we take a copy instead?
      Object.assign({}, person, { age: 24 });
      // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

      // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
      // also you could check and use JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(newbie))
